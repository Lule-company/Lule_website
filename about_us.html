		<h1>About us</h1>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Our concept</h3>
	
	<P>
		Lule is a new brand that offers sustainable school products for children from 3 to 12 years old.
	</P>
	
	<p>
		We offer school bags, reusable bottles, pencil cases, snack bags and suitcases. The common aspect that links the different products is the fabrics and materials used. Indeed, we create sustainable products made from recycled fabrics. (For school bags we use recycled cotton whereas for bottles we use recycled aluminum or recycled plastic to create them).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The idea being Lule is to offer sustainable products that will evolve with the children over the years. Indeed, as the children grow, needs are going to chang . With Lule parents can buy a product and send it back to the company when it will be worned off. We promotes a circular economy model where products will be used multiple times to limit the carbon footprint and the impact of the company on the planet.
